# go-google-charts
A Golang wrapper that use google charts in the backend as templates. Currently, only OrgCharts are utilized. Very useful for pdf generation. The idea is to build a JSON object ( can be from an API call ) and pass it to the template with 3 pre-defined columns: value, parent_value & row_type.
